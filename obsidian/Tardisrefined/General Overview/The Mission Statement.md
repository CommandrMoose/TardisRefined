_Or what this mod is trying to achieve._

*TARDIS: Refined* is a Minecraft mod based on the world of Doctor Who which adds a personal, teleporting base to the game. As of writing this document, there are already a number of mods that do the same and the members of this development team have been involved in those projects in different capacity.  *TARDIS: Refined* aims to take the best components and unused potential of the development team's contributions and bring them together in one grand project.

*TARDIS: Refined* is not a project that aims to be more than it presents. All features/content serve a purpose that builds the overall player experience. The project explores the nature of the TARDIS, how it operates and how its personality can shine through even if there is not a physical interface that can express that emotion.
